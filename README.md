# Coffee Sales Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves an analysis of coffee sales data from a cafeteria to derive valuable insights into sales performance. The analysis was conducted using Power BI with building measures (with DAX queries), along with SQL documentation for cross-verification of the DAX query outputs. The project culminated in a two-page report generated in Power BI, showcasing the findings through interactive visualizations.

## Key Features

### 1. Power BI Analysis:

#### 1. Data Visualization: 

Various visualizations (such as bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts) were created in Power BI to represent different aspects of coffee sales.
#### 2. DAX Measures: 
Custom measures were built using Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to calculate KPIs like total sales, average sales, and sales distribution by product type, location, and time.

### 2. SQL Documentation:

#### 1. DAX to SQL Mapping: 
A detailed documentation was created to translate DAX queries into corresponding SQL queries. This helps in verifying the correctness of the calculations and the DAX measures.
#### 2. SQL Queries for Validation: 
SQL queries were developed to cross-check the outputs generated by DAX measures and ensure data consistency.

### 3. Final Report:

A two-page report was built in Power BI to present the results of the analysis. It includes key insights, trends, and interactive filters for stakeholders to explore the data in an intuitive way.

### 4. Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of coffee sales records from a cafeteria from the month of January to the month of June. The data includes following features:

   - Order ID
   - Product Type
   - Sales Amount
   - Order Date
   - Location
   - Customer Details

## Project Structure
The repository includes the following files and folders:

/data/: Contains the raw dataset used for the analysis.

/reports/: Includes the final two-page Power BI report in .pbix format.

/sql_docs/: Contains SQL documentation with the DAX-to-SQL mappings and corresponding SQL queries.

/measures/: Folder with the DAX measures used in the Power BI report.

README.md: Detailed explanation of the project, methodology, and instructions for usage.

## Getting Started
  - Open the Power BI Report
  - Download the Power BI .pbix report from the reports folder and open it using Power BI Desktop.
  - Explore the pre-built visualizations and interact with the filters to gain insights into coffee sales.
  - SQL Query Verification:
      - Open the sql_docs folder and refer to the DAX-to-SQL documentation.
      - Execute the corresponding SQL queries in your database system to cross-check the results with the Power BI visualizations.

## Methodology

#### 1. Data Loading and Preprocessing:

The dataset was imported into Power BI, where basic transformations (like null value handling, data type corrections) were applied.

#### 2. Building Measures:

DAX Queries were created to calculate total sales, average sales per product, sales by location, and monthly trends. These measures were then used in Power BI visualizations.
#### 3. SQL Documentation:

DAX measures were translated into SQL queries to cross-check the output and ensure data accuracy. Each DAX formula is accompanied by its equivalent SQL statement.

#### 4. Power BI Reporting:

The final two-page report includes interactive charts, KPIs, and slicers to filter data by product type, location, and time period. The report provides an overview of the coffee sales performance across different dimensions.

## Insights and Results

#### Page 2:
- The Waterfall Chart depicts the Week over Week sales and shows the total increase in the sales in the course of six months has increased by 75.6%
- The Line Chart showscases the fall in total units of product sold and total sales each product wise by the cafeteria.
- The Clustered Bar Chart shows the sales of each product category in each month, as observed the overall sales of all products (except Branded, Flavours, Loose Tea and Packaged Coffee) is the Highest in the month of May. The overall sales of all products is the Lowest in the month of February. 

## Conclusion
This project provides an in-depth analysis of coffee sales data, leveraging the power of DAX and SQL to ensure accurate and actionable insights. The two-page Power BI report serves as a user-friendly tool for visualizing sales trends and driving data-informed decisions for the cafeteria.
